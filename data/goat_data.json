        "history" : ["Goats are among the earliest animals domesticated by humans. The most recent genetic analysis confirms the archaeological evidence that the wild bezoar ibex of the Zagros Mountains is the likely original ancestor of probably all domestic goats today.",
        "Neolithic farmers began to herd wild goats primarily for easy access to milk and meat, as well as to their dung, which was used as fuel; and their bones, hair, and sinew were used for clothing, building, and tools. The earliest remnants of domesticated goats dating 10,000 years Before Present are found in Ganj Dareh in Iran. Goat remains have been found at archaeological sites in Jericho, Choga Mami, Djeitun, and Çayönü, dating the domestication of goats in Western Asia at between 8,000 and 9,000 years ago.",
        "Studies of DNA evidence suggests 10,000 years ago as the domestication date.",
        "Historically, goat hide has been used for water and wine bottles in both traveling and transporting wine for sale. It has also been used to produce parchment."],
        "faq" : ["What are those funny things dangling from their throats?",
        "These are known as toggles or tassels. They appear on both males and females in quite a few of the different breeds. Not all goats have them. No one knows their original purpose, but they are just hollow pieces of gristle, covered with hair with no known essential purpose.",         
        "Do goats need to be tethered?",
        "Tethering is one of the worst ways to keep goats. If done correctly tethering is very time consuming, goats have to be moved frequently and must always have access to shelter and water. Tethered goats are at the mercy of stray dogs and they rarely are as productive as free range animals. Good stock fencing or electric fencing is the best way of retaining goats.Is it true that goats eat anything?",
        "Do goats smell?",
        "It is untrue that all goats smell. Female goats kept in good condition will smell of nothing other than clean straw and sweet hay. As their droppings are of a dry nature they are far easier to keep clean than cows and other farm animals.Uncastrated male goats do smell. Male goats kept for stud purposes have a very strong distinctive smell, especially during the mating season, (August to March). During this period males should only be handled wearing special clothes as the odour is very strong and difficult to eliminate from skin and clothing. For this reason the keeping of male goats is only recommended for experienced breeders.",
        "Do goats headbutt?",
        "If goats are brought up correctly and disciplined from an early age they never develop any bad habits. Goats will butt each other, this is quite natural and normal as they develop an order of dominance in the herd. However if corrected from an early age they never butt humans or other animals.A goat that has been teased may butt people as part of their “play”, which may start as kids, when it is no problem. It can be a problem if this behaviour extends to adult age and size. Hence start correctly: if a small kid pushes against your legs, never push back.",
        "Does goats’ milk have a strong taste?",
        "Goats’ milk that is hygienically produced tastes little different from cows milk. Milk that tastes strong or “goaty’ has not been produced correctly.",
        "Is goat meat tough?",
        "Most goat meat available for sale is kid meat, but some animals are slaughtered when more mature. It is tender and virtually fat free. It is similar to lamb, but has a pleasant flavour of its own. Any male kids that are not wanted for stud work can be reared for meat.",
        "Are male goats the ones with beards?",
        "Almost all goats grow beards, males usually having a longer and more luxuriant growth. Many people who show goats trim the beards off the females as they feel they look more feminine without them. At agricultural shows all goats exhibited will be females, males are rarely shown due to their smell.",
        "Do goats make good lawnmowers?",
        "Not all breeds of goats are good grazers, but some, such as Angoras and Boers graze well, although selectively. Goats generally prefer to browse and like to vary their diet with more fibrous foods. If you need grass kept down, geese or sheep are better grazers, but in the long run, it will be cheaper, and there will be less maintenance if you buy yourself a lawnmower.Can I use goats’ milk to feed my baby?",
        "What steps need to be taken to sell goats milk?",
        "If you are considering selling your milk for human consumption you should make yourself aware of current government regulations. It is recommended that you purchase a copy of the BGS booklet “Easy Dairying“. (see price list). “Production Holdings” need to be registered: “Dairy Establishments”, where milk undergoes some form of treatment or processing, including packaging for retail sale, are subject to additional requirements and further registration. The booklet describes the standards in goat housing and hygiene required to produce milk, which can be sold confidently to the public.",
        "It is illegal to sell milk for human consumption unless the producer has been licensed to do so.",
        "Milk can be sold for other purposes e.g. feeding puppies, without the premises being registered, but labelling must make clear that the product is not for human consumption."]

Today, three registries exist in the US for Kikos: the AKGA, the IKGA, and the NKR, the latter of which is the largest of the three. Through these agencies, Kikos could be registered as 100% New Zealand, meaning that their lineage can be traced all the way back to the original New Zealand stock. 'Purebreds' refer to goats that are at least 15/16ths New Zealand stock and 'percentages' are those that are at least 50% New Zealand stock. Kiko-Boer crosses can also be registered as Genemaster™ through the NKR. "],

        "Kiko is a meat goat breed hailing from the land of New Zealand. It comes from the Māori word, which means flesh or meat.",

        "This hardy and parasite-resistant breed can live around 8 to 12 years. Some goats who were properly cared for can live past this lifespan.",
        "Can Kiko goats be used for milk?",

        "Pygora kids weigh about 5 lb. at birth. Adult does (female Pygoras) average 80-120 lb. and must be at least 18 in. tall. Adult bucks (male Pygoras) and wethers (neutered males) average 75-140 lb. and must be at least 23 in. tall. There is no maximum height restriction.",
